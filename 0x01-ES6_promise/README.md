# ES6 Promises
## Description
ES6 Promises are a powerful feature in JavaScript for handling asynchronous operations, providing a cleaner, more robust alternative to callbacks. A Promise represents a value that may be available now, in the future, or never, and it has three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected. By using .then(), .catch(), and .finally() methods, developers can specify what should happen when the asynchronous operation succeeds, fails, or completes, respectively. This structured approach enhances readability and maintainability of code, especially when dealing with multiple asynchronous tasks, as it allows chaining of operations and centralizes error handling, thereby avoiding the notorious "callback hell" associated with nested callbacks.
